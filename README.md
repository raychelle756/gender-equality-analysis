# 📊 Daikibo Telemetry & Equality Analysis Project

This project was completed as part of the Deloitte Australia Virtual Experience Program on Forage. It involved analyzing machine downtime data from Daikibo Industrials' factories and assessing gender pay equality across various roles and locations.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Tableau (for data visualization)
- Microsoft Excel (for data classification and logic)
- GitHub (for project documentation and sharing)

## 📁 Project Breakdown

### 1. **Machine Downtime Dashboard**
Analyzed telemetry data collected from four Daikibo factories:
- Tokyo (Meiyo)
- Osaka (Seiko)
- Berlin
- Shenzhen

Each factory reported machine health every 10 minutes for a month (May 2021).  
**Key questions answered:**
- Which location experienced the most machine failures?
- Which machine types were responsible for the most downtime?

✅ Delivered a Tableau dashboard with:
- A bar chart showing total downtime per factory
- A breakdown of downtime by device type
- Interactive filtering using Tableau Dashboard actions

### 2. **Gender Pay Equality Classification**
Used Excel to classify job roles based on an "Equality Score" ranging from -100 to +100.

**New Column Added:**
- `Equality Class`, with categories:
  - `Fair` (between -10 and +10)
  - `Unfair` (between -20 and -11 or 11 and 20)
  - `Highly Discriminative` (less than -20 or greater than +20)

📄 `Equality Table – Edited.xlsx` — Final equality classification table
